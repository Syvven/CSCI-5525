How To Run:

In terminal, when cd'd into directory containing code,
input "py hw3_qN.py" where the capital N is replaced with 2 or 3
for which question you want to run. 

Assumptions being made include having a folder in same directory
as the python files called "model_saves" which contains two files 
that are named cnn_best_model.pt and mlp_best_model.pt
